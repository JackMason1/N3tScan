# NetScan ðŸ”Ž

## Description
NetScan is a tool designed to assist with external infrastructure and web application assessments. It simplifies the process of identifying valid web pages, detecting a range of vulnerabilities, and presenting the findings in easy-to-understand markdown tables for integration into Secure Portal.

## Requirements
To install this tool the following requirements need to be met:
- Homebrew installed
- Python installed
- Pip installed
- This tool can only be run on a Mac

## Installation
To install NetScan, follow these steps after downloading it from GitHub:

1. **Relocate the Installed Folder**: Move the downloaded folder to a permanent location on your system. Once set up, the folder cannot be moved as the startup script relies on its current location.
2. **Open Terminal**: Navigate to the folder in your terminal.
3. **Run Setup Script**: Execute `./setup.sh` in the terminal. This script installs all necessary dependencies and sets up the start script.

## Usage
To run NetScan, type `NetScan` in your terminal after installation and setup.



## Start a Scan

#### Nmap Input
- **File Type**: Accepts only `.txt` files.
- **Usage**: Upload a `.txt` file containing the full output of an Nmap scan. NetScan will parse this file and try each IP/port combination for public-facing web pages.

#### Domain Input
Enter hosts and ports you wish to scan in the domain input field, which accepts both valid domain names and IP addresses.

- **Default Ports**: Scans ports 80, 443, 8080, and 8443 by default.
- **Custom Ports**: To specify different ports, use the syntax:
  - `jackmason.com:443`
  - `jackmason.com:80,443`
- **Integration**: Matches domain names with inputs from an Nmap scan to access pages that require a valid domain name.

### Settings
Access the settings tab at the top right of the application to activate or deactivate modules. You must press the `Close and Save` button to update the settings; otherwise, they will not be saved.
- **Note**: Active scans require explicit permission from the customer.
